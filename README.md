# Profile-Badges
neat Badges for your readme profile (still a concept)

to add to your readme...

```
<div id="badge" align="right">
<img src="https://github.com/zoeeechu/Profile-Badges/blob/main/Pride%20Badges/Dev_Trans.png?raw=true" title="This Developer is Trans" width="30"/>
</div>
```

> replace the file url with which ever badge you want as well as the alt text
